# Clothed Under Grace Software Project
 Software Engineering Project for Clothed Undergrace developed by the Technocrats to provide functionality to make the day to day operations of the business easier.

# Client Issue Description: 
Clothed Under Grace Printing is a custom printing company that provides services to the general public. They specialize in customized apparel and memorabilia such as  mugs, pillows, tumblers and other products. Currently, they collect and store information about customers' orders, as well as, interact with customers  through social media.
	Due to the inefficiency of social media messaging systems, orders placed by clients are frequently handled over a 24-72 business hour period. As a result, it is challenging to maintain a precise and thorough record of order data, client details, and stock inventory when everything is done on a mobile device via the relevant social media platform, such as WhatsApp or Instagram. Therefore, a program is required to maintain order information and facilitate the customer interaction required to complete a purchase

# Software Components:
1. Order Management: This requirement is necessary as it should allow employees to enter order details as orders are placed to the companyâ€™s direct messages.
2. Order Status: This requirement is necessary as it should allow employees to update the status of orders to pending, completed or cancelled thus keeping up to date with each order's progress.
3. Stock Management: This requirement is necessary to keep track of the flow of goods in and out of the company.
4. Search Management:  This requirement is necessary as it should allow employees to search for an order information from the list of orders available instead of manually thus cutting search time.
5. Invoice Generation: This requirement is necessary as it helps both the seller and the buyer to keep track of their payments and amounts owed. 
6. Stock Alert: This requirement is necessary as it should allow the business to keep track of low stocked items in order to keep inventory levels high for influx of customer orders.
